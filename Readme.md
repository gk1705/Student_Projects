# Projects

This repository includes the following projects, where each folder represents a different project, ordered in chronological fashion:

 * [Triangle Escape Simulator (second semester project)](1_te_simulator/)
 * [Isolation Arena (third semester project)](2_is_arena/)
 * [Necroformancy (fourth semester project)](3_le_necroformancy/)
 * [Caravan Chaos (bachelor final project)](4_cc_chaos/)

# Triangle Escape Simulator

## Summary

The player steers an arrow and manoeuvres it through a labyrinth
while avoiding various obstacles. These hurdles include blockages, damaging barriers, floating objects
and towers that shoot at the player. The challenge is to find keys, open doors and to get to the exit without colliding with obstacles.

## Notable

* Implemented in [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/), 2D, C#
* Data driven initialization of game elements via [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
* Line of sight algorithm and A* algorithm for enemy behaviour
* Bloom shader to enhance visuals

# Isolation Arena

## Summary

Isolation Arena is a skill-based one-on-one local multiplayer game. Each player is assigned to a
playing field they cannot leave. However, players can hurt each other by means of projectiles. Periodically, monsters appear in both fields, who only only attack the player in the same field.
If these monsters are defeated, they appears in the opponent's field. The challenge is to strike a balance between attacking the opponent and monsters in the same playing field.

## Notable

* Implemented in a self written game engine, 2D, C++
* Collaboration of two developers
* Uses design patterns and component based architecture
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) as underlying framework with [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) for the graphical user interface

# Necroformancy

## Summary

In Necroformancy you play a necromancer who builds formations from his devotees and sends them
into battle. If enemy units die, they can be integrated directly into your own formation by
resurrection. At any time, it is possible to call upon a formation grid to place your units cleverly
around you. Accordingly, it is advantageous to place your units around you to be protected from
damage. The goal is to build up as large an army as possible.

## Notable

* Implemented in [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/de), 3D, C#
* Collaboration between three developers
* Clean code, modular architecture
* Behaviour trees for complex AI

# Caravan Chaos

## Summary

Caravan Chaos is a local multiplayer game for two-to-four people.
Each player controls a car with a caravan and has to disconnect the caravan at the right moment and angle to hit their opponents. Last one standing is victorious. 
Furthermore, there are alternative modes in which, for example, the players compete in a soccer tournament or pass each other a bomb in Hot Potato like fashion.

## Notable

* Implemented in [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/de), 3D, C#
* Collaboration between four developers
* Car and caravan physics from scratch
* Custom system for persistent skid marks
* [Featured in the FM4 Indie Area 2019](https://fm4.orf.at/stories/2992485/)
* [Download Build](https://portfolio.multimediatechnology.at/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaFZEIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--c6055e3fc17e161bddcf847b63ea1ba703a118f4/CaravanChaos310719.zip)

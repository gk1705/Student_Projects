# Control schemes

* Subtleties of the gamepad control variant are significantly better calibrated

## Gamepad control

* Move -> Left stick

* Aim -> Right stick

* Fire projectile -> Upper right shoulder button

* Special Power (when blue bar is full) -> Upper left shoulder button / A

* Pause -> Start

## Mouse & keyboard control

* Move -> WASD

* Aim -> Mouse

* Fire projectile (relative to mouse position) -> Spacebar

* Special Power (when blue bar is full) -> Ctrl left

## Solo Testing

The game is primarily designed for two players with two gamepads. As such the game only starts when both players have registered and confirmed their selection. However, one can test the functionality on their own using the mouse to navigate the menu.
If done so, they control the character on the left side of the screen without a second player.
